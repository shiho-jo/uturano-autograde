# **uturano-autograde**

## About Our Group

Our group name **Uturano (ウトゥラノ)**, inspired by a term in the Ainu (aboriginal Hokkaido) language, means “together.” This symbolizes our first collaborative programming project in university. We hope to be a good team and also good friends. Below is our group and member information:

## About This Project

This project is a prototype of a part of an **Automated Assessment System** integrated with the CSRS platform to streamline the grading process for programming assignments in Java. It supports parsing, comparing them with skeleton code (allows helper methods or classes, but detect mismatch on imports and parameters), and run tests based on JUnit file on student `.java` code files, to demonstrate the basic mechanism. The project also includes a series of front-end pages to illustrate how the management interface should work. Some functionalities, such as API support, are still in progress, so in its current state, only the back-end is operational.

## Supported Versions

Our prototype currently supports **JDK 23** for compiling code files.

## Setting Up

To get started, run the following command in the top folder for Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux or macOS):

```bash
./gradlew runWithArgs <codeDir> <skeletonDir> <junitFile> <outputDir>
```

Alternatively, you can manually run the `Main` class with arguments:

```bash
./gradlew run --args="<codeDir> <skeletonDir> <junitFile> <outputDir>"
```

For Windows, use:

```bash
./gradlew.bat runWithArgs <codeDir> <skeletonDir> <junitFile> <outputDir>
```

## What's Left to be Added/Fixed

- API Integration
- User-defined Mark Tables
- File Structure Improvements
- Setting Page and Sidebar Issues in Front-End
- Manual Comments and Reviews

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to my group members for making this a great teamwork experience. Even though this is my first time working on a full-stack project, I am grateful for their support during my exchange semester in Birmingham.

I also pay my respect to the Ainu culture and their elders, their footprints in Hokkaido and the world, in the past, present, and future.
